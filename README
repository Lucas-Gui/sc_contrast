# SC - Contrast

## Requirements

We do not provide a requirements file because some packages are only available in pip (not conda), and pytorch should be installed separately depending on your system requirements.

This code needs the following packages :
```
python=3.11
pytorch=2.1
seaborn
pandas
openpyxl 
scikit-learn
tqdm
tensorboard
jupyter
configargparse
sp1md # for Hotelling's t test 
```

Package versions are supplied as used, but the later version should work as well.
